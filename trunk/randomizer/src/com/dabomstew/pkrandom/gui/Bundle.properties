RandomizerGUI.tpPowerLevelsCB.toolTipText=<html>If this is checked, the random Pokemon that replaces each Pokemon will be of similar power to the original.<br />However, preserving other rules such as type theming has precedence over this, so weaker or stronger Pokemon will be chosen if there are no other Pokemon available.
