# General DS Games #
  * The sprites, names or cries of the starter Pokemon shown when you pick one may not be updated when they are randomized or manually set in the randomizer. This is due to a lack of knowledge on appropriate code offsets etc and not a bug.
  * For all DS games except Black2/White2, Pokedex Area data is not updated when you randomize Wild Pokemon. This should eventually be fixed for Black/White 1 but it is unlikely to be fixed for Generation 4 games.


# Generation Four Games #
  * Nothing right now.

# Generation Five Games #
  * A battle with Zinzolin isn't consistent with his other battles.
  * At least in Black 2/White 2, Habitat List is not updated if you randomize Wild Pokemon. For now, this cannot be fixed.
