# Update 26/02/2014 #
There has been a new version (1.5.0) released, but you cannot download it here because Google Code no longer allows hosting new downloads of binaries for the randomizer.

The latest source code will still be available here under the Source tab.

**To download the new version, [click here](http://pokehacks.dabomstew.com/randomizer/downloads.php). New versions will always be hosted there from now on.**

# Summary #
The Universal Pokemon Randomizer is a program which will give you a new experience playing Pokemon games. In the same vein as previously released randomizers, it provides a customized gameplay experience by allowing you to randomize many things:

  * The Starter Pokemon choices
  * The Wild Pokemon you encounter in grass, caves and other places
  * The Pokemon that Trainers use against you.
  * The base stats which define the potential of each Pokemon
  * The elemental types of each Pokemon
  * The abilities of each Pokemon, in the games that have abilities.
  * The moves that Pokemon learn by gaining levels
  * The contents of each TM which can be taught to Pokemon to give them additional moves (HM moves are not changed to make sure you can still beat the game)
  * The capability of each Pokemon to learn each TM or HM move.
  * The "static" Pokemon which you either are given, fight on the overworld, or are sold.
  * The names of trainers & the classes they belong in.
  * The moves taught by move tutors, for games within which they are significant enough.

Naturally, you are able to choose exactly what is randomized in your particular ROM. If randomizing things like Pokemon types is just too confusing or unenjoyable, the randomization can be easily tailored to your particular needs.

This program would not exist without the efforts of those in the [Acknowledgements](http://pokehacks.dabomstew.com/randomizer/acks.php).
